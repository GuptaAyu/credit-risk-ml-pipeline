# Credit Risk ML Pipeline

An end-to-end machine learning pipeline for **credit card default risk prediction**, covering data validation, preprocessing, model training, and Flask-based deployment.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts whether a credit card customer is likely to default on payment using historical financial and demographic data.  
It follows **industry-grade ML pipeline practices** including schema validation, automated data ingestion, clustering-based modeling, and REST API deployment.
